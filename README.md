# WearableRecyclerView Android Wear OS example

If you tried to use <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/ui/lists">WearableRecyclerView</a>,

I rebuilt <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51716173/wearablerecyclerview-android-wear-os">stackoverflow question</a>
to this repository while I understood. I hope it will be useful to someone else.  
What it looks like:
